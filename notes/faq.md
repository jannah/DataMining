Frequently asked Questions
============================

A lot people have asked me similar questions and I suppose it might be beneficial if I shared it with the entire class. 

## 1. Technical Expertise & Prerequisites
As Jimmy mentioned in class, you would need some probability and statistics knowledge, python knowledge as this would be our main programming language through which we would be exploring the Data Mining techniques, as well as some basic shell commands. For ISchool students the pre-requisite is Info 206 

## 2. Python/Programming expertise
Python is a fairly easy to learn language with concise syntax and is incredibly powerful. It is a high-level language and plays nice with lower level languages like C/Java. 
So, people who have had programming experience with other languages like C/C++/Java can always leverage your knowledge of the concepts with Python's syntax. Honestly, I came from a Javascript background and found the transition not that difficult. Languages may differ in their syntax but concepts like OOP are common. 

We are always here to help, but having said that Python is a pre-requisite and hence we leave it to the individual to pursue learning the language. 

Below are some resources that I have found useful for learning Python:

#### Python Textbooks

- "[Think Python]" by Allen B. Downey. 
    - The book is very well written and probably just a little over 200 pages, which makes it quite a light reading (at least compared to others), and covers a lot of ground.
- "[Python Cookbook]" by Alex Martelli, Anna Ravenscroft, David Ascher
    - They have some excellent python _recipes_ for common tasks.

#### Python tutorials
I know there are CodeAcademy and probably Coursera courses, but I haven't used either, so I can't personally vouch for them. 

Instead, I personally used NetTuts' "[Python from Scratch]" videos. They were just a few of them, and it didn't take that long to do them

#### D-Lab
[D-Lab] is a wonderful center on campus, set up to help budding Data Scientists. They have 1-2 day workshops, courses and can be reached out to for help. Please refer the [D-Lab Calendar] for list of their upcoming events. 


## 3. Data Mining vs Open Data
Although, I responded to this in class but some students still had certain doubts. I would rather not like to give my personal opinion here because I haven't taken the Open Data course myself.

Might I suggest comparing the corresponding textbooks, at least the table of contents. It might give an idea about the concepts that are going to be covered. Open Data, Data Mining and even InfoViz overlap a lot and also have their separate goals probably.
